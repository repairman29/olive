# Olive Beta — How to test (and why you’re here)

**You’re not just “testing an app.”** You’re helping shape a kitchen companion that’s meant to feel like a helpful friend at the counter — one that remembers what you like, finds the right stuff at your store, and gets out of the way when you’re done.

This guide is your 1-page cheat sheet: what Olive is, why we’re asking you, and how to get the most out of it (and us).

## Why Olive exists

Most of us already know *what* we need. The friction is: typing it into yet another app, hunting for the right product, and hoping the cart doesn’t feel like a chore. Olive is built to **take the chore out** — you keep a simple list (or paste a recipe link), pick your store and how you shop (Budget vs Splurge), and Olive tucks the right items into your **Kroger / King Soopers** cart. You stay in control; we just make the hand-off smooth.

**You’re here because** we want real people using it in real life. Your feedback — what felt great, what felt confusing, what you wish Olive did next — is how she gets better. No corporate survey vibes; we want the kind of “kitchen counter” conversation you’d have with a friend who’s helping you shop.

## How to use Olive (quick path)

1. **Go to [shopolive.xyz](https://shopolive.xyz)** and sign up (or sign in).
2. **Connect Kroger** when prompted — Olive uses this to add items to *your* cart. She never sees your password and never places an order without you.
3. **Set your store** (ZIP → pick your King Soopers or Kroger). That’s how we find the right products and prices.
4. **Add stuff to your list**  
   - Type items (e.g. *milk, eggs, bread*).  
   - Or **Shop for a recipe** — pick a saved recipe, search the web, or **paste a recipe link** (AllRecipes, Food Network, etc.) and Olive pulls the ingredients.  
   - Use **Quick add** for things you add often.
5. **Choose Budget or Splurge** — Budget = sale items and best price per unit; Splurge = preferred brands when we know them.
6. **Add to Kroger Cart** — Olive searches your store and adds matches. Then **Open my cart** to review and checkout in Kroger.

That’s the loop: **list → Add to Kroger Cart → open cart in Kroger.** The more you use it, the more Olive learns your usuals and preferences.

## What we need from you

- **Use it like you mean it.** Add a real list, paste a real recipe, hit Add to Kroger Cart. The best feedback comes from actually doing a run.
- **Tell us what felt off.** Wrong brand? Confusing step? “I wish Olive had…” — we want to hear it. You’re not complaining; you’re helping her get better.
- **Answer Olive when she asks.** If you see a banner like *“Did I find the right brands for you?”* or *“How did I do with your last list?”* — a quick tap (Nailed it / Not quite / Saved me time / I have an idea) teaches Olive and makes the product better for everyone.

You’re part of a small group that’s defining what “Olive” becomes. Your time and honesty are a real investment in that. Thank you.
